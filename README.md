# Timing_hallmarks

Here is the code (in R Markdown files) for the figures (3 panels) from "The temporal evolution of cancer hallmarks" doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.576566

There is also the code for Supplementary figures. 

The data used is public and available on TCGA (for pancancer) and GTEx (normal tissues). You can find the data used on https://zenodo.org/records/10805608. 

The list of hallmark genes can be found in Supplementary table 2 of the following article: "CHG: A Systematically Integrated Database of Cancer Hallmark Genes".

Hope this helps!
